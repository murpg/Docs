## Creating Additional ColdFusion Instances in a Secure Baseline Environment {#coldfusion-instances}

This comprehensive guide details the process of creating additional ColdFusion instances in a security-hardened (secure baseline) environment, with a particular focus on environments using custom service accounts instead of the default System account. The document provides detailed PowerShell scripts for managing services, setting up registry permissions, and handling the file structure required for new ColdFusion instances.

The guide is particularly valuable for system administrators and DevOps engineers working in secure environments, as it includes extensive error handling, verification steps, and best practices. It covers everything from basic setup to troubleshooting common issues, with special attention paid to service account permissions and proper service management in a security-baseline environment.
